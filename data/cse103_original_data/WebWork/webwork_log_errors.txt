The following is an example showing, WebWork isn't always correct and consistent.  We (TA's/professors) may have changed the answer to the 8th part of these poker questions, or WebWork may be buggy.  
Notice: 78 is correct, then 14!/(2!12!) is incorrect, and (13!/11!)/2 is correct.  But (13!/11!)/2 is not equal to 78 ?!?!
